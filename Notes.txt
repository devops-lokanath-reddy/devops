Github Notes -1stday 10-05-2022
--------------------------------

git bash need to be installed on macbook/Windows 

before this should have github account and create New org, repo, teams, members and provide repo access to team members 

login to git bash on local windows machine

git --verison  --> to check github version

cd ~/Desktop and create a dir on desktop with project name like walmart or filpkart 

then cd walmart or flipkart --> here only we are practicing the git bash commands 

execute git init --> then create local repo on same folder 

   /users/username/Desktop/walmart --> this is the path 

IDE's (using this developers are developing the codes) --> Integrated Development environments  ex: eclipse, intelliJ, V S C ( visual studio code), Atom

git bash Commands
-------------------

1) Vi DButils.java or StringUtils.java or deply.sh --> create a file with VI editor 

here we have 3 stages like working area, staging area, local repo --> files are moving one stage to anthoer stage by using git bash commadns 

2) git status --> to checkfile status

3) git add . or git add * or git add *.java or git add DBUtils.java --> to change file pattern  

4) git config --global user.name "reddylokanath"

5) git config --global user.eamil "reddylokanath.anki@gmail.com"

6) git config --global --list 

7) git commit -m "message"

8) getting connection from local repo to remote repo by using commands

  git remote add  WM  "https://github.com/devops-lokanath-reddy/flipkart.git 
                 alias
9) git remote -v --> to check existing connected URl's

10) git push WM master --. to push the all files to remote repo

11) here first time we need to give github username and password or PAT(personal authentication token) and these pasword are stored in local machine --> credentials manager or keychain access

12) to get token goto github site and in that settings> developer settings> personal access tokens 

13) then run the command --> git push WM master -- now all files are moved to remote repository

14) after pusshig if any file got modified then use --> git add . > git commit -a -m "message" > git push WM master 

15) git log --> to find all commits in local repo

16) git log -2 --> to find last updated 2 commits in local repo 

17) git show <commit id> --> to check what user changed on particulaar commit id 

18) git show --pretty="" --name-only <commit id > --> to find file name with updated commit id 





Day 2 class notes 
-------------------------


Go to project path and execute the below commands

git status 

create any two files like .txt and .py files 

git status

git clean -n --> it will ask if you want to remove files

git clean -f --> it will clean immediately all the non committed files which are newly files located in working area 

add one more repository using git remote add alias "URL"

git remote remove alias name --> to remove existing remote URL

create an account on gitlab and bitbucket and map remote repository URL with local git repository and push the codes to there 

create any 3 files like .js and .css .rb 

git status

git add .

git reset --> if we forgot about code status and wants to get back all the files from staging area to working area 

git reset filename --> to get back particular files from staging area to working area

git status 

once any file get updated with any points it will automatically get back from stage to working area 

git add .

git status

git commit -m "message"

git push WM master --> to push the codes to remote repository

git revert <commit id > --> to rollback the codes and deleting newly created files with same commit id which are updated on particular commit id by user

Note: 
-----

it is possible to revert only recent last commit id only not previous commit ids 

after revert run push command to update the codes in remote repository 


Note:
------
in remote repository every files which are pushed from local repo to remote repo each file have right side commit ids those are calling as commit id or version id or revision id 

V C S ( version control system)
---------

git --> VCS or DCVS distributed version control system
SVN
tfs
CVS --> these above three except git are dont have local repo, its has to connect to remote repo and perform the codes 

S C M 
------

Github --> it is a SCM (source code management) and remote repository and it is providing GUI and it is a hosted service for git 
bitbucket
gitlab

for the above three SCMs we can use same commands by using git and these are created and developed on top of git only.

Note : 
--------
here we can create .gitignore file and add any files which are like .classpath and .project inside the .gitignore file 

if we dont want to commit any files (like .classpath and .project or any dirnames ) we can use above .gitignore file 

after all these if we commit also only .gitignore file going to commit thats it and it only can push into remote repository 

Branches 
--------

master, development, dev , uat, prod

git status  

git branch --> how many branches are in local repo 

git branch branch name --> to create a new branch 

git branch -d branch name --> to delete a branch

git checkout branch name --> to switch to other branch 

git commit -a -m " message" 

git diff branch name --> to compare or find the differences the current branch codes or files vs command given other branch name 

git merge branch name --> to copy or replace the current branch codes  files with  command given other branch name

Note:
------
when you are updating code on any branch with out commit dont switch to other branch it is not better practice 

if you have not committed the code will reflect on other branch also
